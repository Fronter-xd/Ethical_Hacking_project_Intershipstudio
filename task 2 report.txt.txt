Title : CROSS SITE SCRIPTING

domain: websecurity.com

subdomain: zero.websecurity.com

Vulnerability : this site is allowing http method and the X-Content-Type-Header is not set.

IMPACT : http methods like POST ,PUT ,DELETE can be harmful for the website like put method could allow clients to save files on the web server
         and DELETE - method can allow clients to remove files on the web server and 
         the X-Content-Type-Header could allow the user agent to render the content of the site in a different fashion to the MIME type.

MITIGATION : configure the web server to return a 405 Method Not Allowed status code. Doing so will reduce the likelihood of HTTP verb tampering vulnerabilities being exploited.
